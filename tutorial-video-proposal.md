# Title: Adding More Monero Development Video Tutorials 

# Content:

When it comes to the development of Monero - you have at least 2 distinct parts:

1) The protocol itself, written in C++, and implemented by the wallets and daemon that users and miners use.
2) The applications built to utilise Monero.

#1 is generally going well.

#2 - I hope we can accelerate

## How?

Iâ€™m proposing we expand the quantity of YouTube tutorial vidoes (mirrored to decentralised YT alternatives)

These would walk the user through some basic, but essential functions, that they can then use in their own apps.

Using popular languages such as Python and Javascript.

## Examples of the types of videos needed:

* How to connect to the RPC*

In the scenario of a membership site:

* Creating new subaddresses per user
* Checking if the current month has been paid for
* Allowing or restricting access based on payment status

In the scenario of an eCommerce store:

* Again, creating subaddresses per user
* Checking if the payment has been received
* Allowing you to update the interface based on payment status

*YouTuber elibro has already made a [good example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55zn419eFcY) of this for Python

## How do we acheive this?

2 options:

1) We ask for volunteers (and potentially fund them a small amount for their time)

2) We run a competition. So for example, we specify the videos we want created by x date, and offer the best 2 versions of these y amount of Monero

I'm in favour of #2 personally.

Let me know your thoughts?
